# Microaudio
Microaudio is a framework developed in C++ that offers different tools to facilitate the development of real-time audio applications in the embedded field. It contains several classes and utilities, exposed as header files that can be imported into your projects as needed.

Having no external dependency beyond the standard C ++ library, microaudio can be easily integrated into any small or large project, being agnostic to building systems and thus just ready to be used in many different scenarios.

## Philosophy
The goal of this framework is to allow its users to reduce their coding time by providing the necessary tools to focus their attention on what should really matter: audio software development. Indeed, the implementation of real time software for audio can hide numerous pitfalls, which can easily be avoided by using suitable design patterns, proposed and tested within microaudio.

Using this code base, you can take advantage of some guidelines to follow, exposed by the classes of the framework itself, which will help you develop embedded audio code more easily, without having to reinvent the wheel every time.
